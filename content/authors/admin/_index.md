    summary: |
      My current focus is on non-stationary time series. These are time series that can show trends and shifts in distribution. Non-stationary time series are difficult to study. As a result, very few general results are known, such as central limit theorems and bootstrap methods. From a practical point of view, however, data are rarely stationary, which stresses the need for such results. The overall goal is to a) extend fundamental theorems in probability theory and statistics and b) generalise practical algorithms, such as the bootstrap, to the non-stationary context.

      1.0 (with distinction)

      During my Master's degree I specialised in algebraic geometry and category theory. For my Master's thesis, I proved the proper base change theorem in etale cohomology - a crucial theorem needed to prove Weil's Conjecture. While this theorem is well known, its proof relies on a complex series of arguments which are now - hopefully - more accessible.

      1.4 (very good)
      
      During my undergraduate studies I focused on algebra and category theory. For my bachelor's thesis, I studied locally presentable categories, which provide insights into many categorical constructions.

#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Hi I'm Nico Palm. I am a mathematician and currently pursuing my PhD
at the [Munich Center for Machine learning](https://mcml.ai) (LMU) 
under the supervision of [Thomas Nagler](https://tnagler.github.io).
Before that I worked for a couple of startups in the broad field of data analysis and machine learning.
I specialize in the intersection of machine learning and statistics/mathematics: 
I develop statistical/mathematical methods that meet the requirements of modern data science, 
explore and prove their theoretical properties and package them in user-friendly software.
