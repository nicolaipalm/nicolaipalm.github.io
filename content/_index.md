        My current focus is on non-stationary time series. These are time series that can show trends and shifts in distribution. Non-stationary time series are difficult to study. As a result, very few general results are known. From a practical point of view, however, data are rarely stationary, which stresses the need for such results. My overall goal is to a) generalize fundamental theorems of probability theory (e.g. central limit theorems) and statistics and b) extend practical algorithms, such as the bootstrap, to the non-stationary context.

        I am also interested in:

        - The broad area of uncertainty quantification for ML models, mainly from a frequentist perspective
        - Category theory in ML 
        - Multi-objective optimization especially in the context of expensive blackbox functions (e.g. simulation or digital twin models)
        - Applying all this to real scenarios
