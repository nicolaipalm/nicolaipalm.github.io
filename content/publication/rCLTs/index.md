abstract: "Statistical inference for non-stationary data is hindered by the lack of classical central limit theorems (CLTs), not least because there is no fixed Gaussian limit to converge to. To address this, we introduce relative weak convergence, a mode of convergence that compares a statistic or process to a sequence of evolving processes. Relative weak convergence retains the main consequences of classical weak convergence while accommodating time-varying distributional characteristics. We develop concrete relative CLTs for random vectors and empirical processes, along with sequential, weighted, and bootstrap variants, paralleling the state-of-the-art in stationary settings. Our framework and results offer simple, plug-in replacements for classical CLTs whenever stationarity is untenable, as illustrated by applications in nonparametric trend estimation and hypothesis testing."
